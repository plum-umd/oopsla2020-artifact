## Overview

This is the artifact for [Verifying Replicated Data Types with Typeclass Refinements in Liquid Haskell](#TODO). 
We provide a `Dockerfile` that can be used to run and benchmark the proofs, as well as the example VRDT applications. 
Build the docker image with `docker build -t liquid-typeclasses .` (This will take a while).
Run the image with `docker run -it liquid-typeclasses /bin/bash`.
